# Week 6, 02-03-2020 - 06-03-2020
## Done
Has decided to use TeaStore and to implement OpenTracing on it. I have also written some in the report about distributed tracing, pods, etc. I have also read the other students reports in preperation of the pear review next monday.
## Problems
The biggest problem im facing now is to implement OpenTracing on TeaStore. I talked to Johan and he said to give it about 2 weeks then if it fail go back to an application that already implements tracing. 
## Do
Start out the week with the pear review. Learn how to implement OpenTracing on an application. Start with the git repo microdonuts as an example.
