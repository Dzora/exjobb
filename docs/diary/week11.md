# Week 11, 30-03-2020 - 03-04-2020
## Done
Got a local dockerfile with TeaStore to talk to Jaeger. 
## Problems
The problems this week was that since TeaStore was using docker compose and Jaeger a regular dockerfile they ended up on two different vitrual networks. 
## Do
Try to push the modified TeaStore to Google Container registry.
