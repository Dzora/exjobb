## Done
Got Jaeger working with HotRod. I can now follow a trace in HotRod to deduce potential errors. 
## Problems
Getting Jaeger and HotRod working took longer than expected thus there was no time to choose distributed tracing framworks for the thesis. 
## Do
Decide on two or more frameworks for the thesis. Look up how to benchmark each framework. One possible solution to that is to run tests on the test-applications without tracing enabled and with tracing enabled and compare the latency.
