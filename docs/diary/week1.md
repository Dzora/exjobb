# Week 1, 20-01-2020 - 24-01-2020
## Done
The project specification has been approved by Henrik and I've finished the project plan. 
## Problems
The only problem with the project plan, is in my opinion that right now I only have 2 documents in the litterature section. Of course more documents will arise but it feels like more could be included there. Also the computer broke down cause of a missing update so that set me back 2h or so.  
## Do
Next week I will find more litterature to read and according to the project plan I will study how tracing works exactly and look over what tools exist in the CNCF landscape.
