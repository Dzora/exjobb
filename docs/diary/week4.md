# Week 4, 10-02-2020 - 14-02-2020
## Done
Decided to focus on Jaeger, Zipkin and Skywalking as the distributed tracing framworks for the thesis.
## Problems
Zipking is much harder to use than Jaeger so this took all my time this week.
## Do
Try to get Zipkin to work and write about distributed tracing in the report. Will also spend some time studing statistic next week.
