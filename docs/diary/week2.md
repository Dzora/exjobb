# Week 2, 27-01-2020 - 31-01-2020
## Done
Set up a kubernetes cluster on GKE and deployed Jaeger and HotRod. Fixed the setup for the report so now all the fine grained detalis should be fixed. Got a better understanding of what tracing is since I read alot of papers/blogpost this week. Understands Kubernetes and Docker much better than last week.  
## Problems
One problem I encounterd this week was that Jaeger and HotRod didn't wanna notice eachother when set up. This is probly due to the first time I set up Jaeger I set it up in developer mode instead of production mode. 
## Do
Check if the problem with Jaeger and HotRod goes away if I set it up in production mode. Choose 2 or more tracing frameworks to observe in the thesis. Learn more about Kubernetes. Will also read about Prometheus.
